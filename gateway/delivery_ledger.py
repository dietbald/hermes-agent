"""Durable delivery-obligation ledger for gateway final responses.

A final agent response that was generated but not yet confirmed-delivered
to the messaging platform is the one artifact the gateway can lose without
a trace: the turn already burned its tokens, the text exists only in a
Python local, and a crash / planned restart between finalize and platform
ACK drops it silently (#58818, #41696, #63695).

This module records a small durable row per outbound final response in the
shared ``state.db`` (same file and conventions as
``tools.async_delegation`` — WAL, owner pid + process-start-time liveness,
bounded retention). The gateway writes three checkpoints around the send:

    record_obligation()   state='pending'     before any send attempt
    mark_attempting()     state='attempting'  immediately before the await
    mark_delivered() /    state='delivered'   only on SendResult.success
    mark_failed()         state='failed'      on a definitive rejection

On startup, ``sweep_recoverable()`` claims rows whose owning process is
dead and hands them to the gateway for redelivery. After a platform adapter
reconnects without a process restart, ``sweep_failed_for_runtime()`` may claim
only the same live process's explicitly allowlisted transient failures. Crash
semantics are explicit about ambiguity (the contract review of the earlier
delivery-outbox attempt, #61790, closed it for silently resending ambiguous
sends):

- ``pending``     — the send never started: redeliver plainly, no dup risk.
- ``attempting``  — crashed mid-await: the platform MAY already have the
  message. Redelivered WITH a visible recovered-reply marker so the
  contract is honest at-least-once, never a silent duplicate.
- ``failed``      — definitively rejected once; the restart is a natural
  retry boundary. Also carries the marker.
- ``delivered``   — nothing to do; retention prunes.

Non-retryable poison rows cannot spin: attempts are capped, stale rows expire,
and both transition to ``abandoned`` (kept briefly for inspection, then pruned).
Transient failures remain durable until delivery or explicit cancellation.

Everything here is best-effort by design: ledger failures must never block
or delay an actual send. Callers wrap every call in try/except.

    ``profile`` scopes multiplexed gateways to the bot identity that actually

    Startup recovery intentionally ignores rows owned by a live gateway. That
    protects concurrent processes, but it also means a final response rejected
    with ``send_path_degraded`` remains stranded when only the platform adapter
    reconnects. This runtime sweep closes that gap without weakening ownership:

    - only rows stamped to this exact process instance are eligible;
    - only explicitly allowlisted transient errors are eligible;
    - attempts/staleness bounds match startup recovery;
    - every update is guarded by the prior owner stamp and ``failed`` state.

    Unowned rows and rows owned by another process are left untouched for the
    normal startup/dead-owner sweep. Claimed rows always carry the reconnect
    marker because the failed send's acknowledgement is not safe to infer.
